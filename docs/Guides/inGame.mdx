RoManager's in-game integration is an easy way to control your game from Discord, or via the API (coming soon).

import {
	DiscordMessages,
	DiscordMessage,
	DiscordMention,
} from "@skyra/discord-components-react";

:::danger Warning

RoManager's game integration is **currently down**. This will **not** work for the time being.

:::

## Prerequisites

- Your game must be either **Public**, or RoManager's bot account must be able to access it
- HTTP requests must be on

## Getting your integration key

Run the `game-key` command, and RoManager will DM you a key. This will be used later, when adding the RoManager client to your game.

	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

:::info

- The key links the place to your **Discord server**, not the group, which means you can use the client for any place, not just group places.

- The RoManager game client is open-source. Check it out at https://github.com/RoManager-org/game-client.

## Adding the RoManager client

To add the RoManager client, you need to open your game in Studio, and create a script in `ServerScriptService`.

Once you've done that, paste this code into the script.

```lua
require(6398753986)({
	INTEGRATION_KEY = 'your integration key here'
})
```

Replace `your integration key here` with your integration key. Do not remove the quotes.

**You have successfully integrated your game with RoManager! The client does not work in Studio, however. Play your game and try it out!**
