RoManager's in-game integration is an easy way to control your game from Discord, or via the API (coming soon).

import {
	DiscordMessages,
	DiscordMessage,
	DiscordMention,
} from "@skyra/discord-components-react";


## Getting your integration key

Run the `game-key` command, and RoManager will DM you a key. This will be used later, when adding the RoManager client to your game.

<DiscordMessages>
	<DiscordMessage
		author="Camptie"

	>

		<code class="discord-codeblock">93db82d67b2a1d520128f36947aea2d9</code>
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

Coming soon...
